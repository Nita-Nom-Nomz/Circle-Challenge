# Circle Challenge (Python OOP: Classes)
CIRCLE OBJECTS

Objectives: Objects, Methods, Member Variables

Task: Calculate a circle’s diameter, circumference and area.

What will the application do?

● Prompt the user to enter a radius; the user may enter a number with decimals (double).

● Display an error if the user enters invalid data and asks the user again for a radius.

● When the user enters valid data, create an instance of a Circle and then use its
methods to display the Diameter, Circumference and Area.

● Ask the user if the circle should grow.

○ If the user says yes, call the grow method and then loop back to the method
    calls for the formulas.
    
        ■ The grow method will double radius.
        
○ If the user says no, display a “goodbye” message and the radius of the circle.
